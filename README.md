# SkyCommerce React, TypeScript

This project was made using React and Typescript.
For the products, I used an api from [DummyJson](https://dummyjson.com/) called [Products](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products)

Currently, an online website is available:

- [SkyCommerce](https://sky-commerce.vercel.app/) using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## About the project

This project was made to see how much progress I have made in frontend development so I put all my efforts in it.
This is a Ecommerce where I tried to use as much functionality as possible to demonstrate that I can do a lot of things.
Used:

- UseState
- UseEffect
- UseContext
- Made my own hooks
- I used some libraries as Framer motion
- Used localStorage to store Products on the cart locally
- And more...

## Run the code
Go to the console, make sure you are in the SkyCommerce folder and run:
